## üåê Live Demo

- **Frontend**: [View on Firebase Hosting](https://college-admission-system-bb0ee.web.app/)  
- **Backend**: [Deployed on Vercel] Please note that the Vercel link is not necessary for this project since it only handles POST operations. The Vercel deployment will not provide you with user data. You can only view the user data directly in the database. The Firebase-hosted frontend handles the user interface and form submissions, but no user data is publicly available through the Vercel link.
